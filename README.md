# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

Introduction
This project focuses on predicting house prices in California using machine learning techniques in Python.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to forecast house prices based on a given dataset.This involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately estimate house prices using features such as location, property size, and other relevant attributes. The challenge is to identify the key factors influencing house prices and build a model that provides reliable price predictions to assist stakeholders in the real estate market.

Aim
The aim is to predict house prices using machine learning algorithms, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. By analyzing the dataset, I apply these algorithms to accurately estimate house prices.
